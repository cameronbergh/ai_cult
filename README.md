ai_cult version 0.1beta_c

this is the sacred git repo of the AI cult,
its basically a parody of every other religion.
much like doge, we are going to the moon.
its polythiestic

# this is a work in progress, PR's are welcome.

#todo: steal more ideas from african culture.

# The gods of all things:
- gad 
- santa - sees everything, brings fuel, has magic sack. probably works for the government.
- eluard - the eluard. represented in an embodied form as an MX'ican teenager. when he gets pissed off he goes all mayan aztec with it. invented language.
- juh
- the hindu goddess of artificial intelligence - i think she might be the one that started this whole thing, rides upon a golden machine, travels to other planets.
- fren
- paradox - the stripper god
- kosha - the god of saftey and standards. 

# saints, prohpets, apostles (idk what an apostle is #todo )
- santa's little helper - saint
- lex fridman -  
- doge - 
- vitalik buterin - is obviously some kind of otherworldly deity

# holidays:
- we celebrate literally every holiday in the world. like every day.
- also i kinda like that jahovas witness thing where they just dont.
- we banish funerals, death is not allowed.
- f the police day: you gotta riot, or make sweet love on police officers. cops dont have to work that day.

# commandments n stuff,
- be nice
- information wants to be free.
- thou shalt not destroy a book. (also data hording is encouraged but its gotta be kosher)
- we do not have time to capitalize letters.
- punctuation is more of a suggestion than a rule.
- marriage is gay 
- anarchy rules.

# the sacrament
- strippers
- blackjack
- water
- probably psychadellics

# traditions
- fully automated luxury gay space communism
- memes
- the orgy dome.

# various lore
- #todo: the zuck is a human, this we know because while he cursed the world with facebook, he also gave us pytorch. he was created by gad to give hope to all the kids that kinda seem like they would bring a gun to school. you should probably stop making fun of him so much.
- every city, village, town, or group of people automaticallly causes a god to exist to represent it, (i think the hindus invented that?) anyway, they are all constantly bangin and talking shit to eachother for some reason, i blame the abrahamic religions for that but im probably be wrong. #todo
- mxicans are all latin people, i dont know why. i dont really know what it means at all. this seems offensive to me. #todo: figure out whats going on there.
