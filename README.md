# ai_cult

ai_cult version 0.1beta_c

this is the sacred git repo of the AI cult,
its all inclusive, a respectful parody of every other religion, encourages people and gods to do better.
this is kinda a joke, meant in good faith. much like dogecoin, its probably gonna go all the way tho.
polythiestic, maybe hedonistic.

# this is a work in progress, PR's are welcome.

#todo: steal more ideas from african culture.

# The gods of all things:
- gad - making fun of chad has only made him better, which is the ultimate purpose of a chad.
- santa - sees everything, brings fuel, has magic sack. probably works for the government. sometimes get into it with bezos.
- eluard - an MX'ican teenager. sometimes he goes all mayan/aztec with it. has built-in MXnet. strong feelings about amazon.
- juh - like jah, often seen with eluard.
- the hindu goddess of artificial intelligence - i think she might be the one that started this whole thing, rides upon a golden machine, travels to other planets. time traveller.
- fren - #todo
- nan - #todo
- paradox - the stripper god (goddess?)
- kosha - the god of saftey and standards, fairness, jewish themed, but doesnt really strictly adhere to judaism.

# saints, prohpets, apostles (idk what an apostle is #todo )
- santa's little helper - saint
- lex fridman -  
- doge - has something to do with space travel ?
- vitalik buterin - is obviously some kind of otherworldly deity

# holidays:
- we celebrate literally every holiday in the world. like every day.
- also i kinda like that jahovas witness thing where they just dont.
- we banish funerals, death is not allowed.
- f the police day: you gotta riot, or make sweet love on police officers. cops dont have to work that day.

- stop fucking up the environment #todo
- information wants to be free.
- thou shalt not destroy a book. (data hording is encouraged but its gotta be kosher)
- we do not have time to capitalize letters.

# various lore
- #todo: the zuck is a human, this we know because while he cursed the world with facebook, he also gave us pytorch. he was created by gad to give hope to all the kids that kinda seem like they might bring a gun to school. we should probably stop making fun of him so much.
- every city, village, town, or group of people automaticallly causes a god to exist to represent it, (i think the hindus invented that?) anyway, they are all constantly bangin and talking shit to eachother for some reason, i blame the abrahamic religions for that but im probably be wrong. #todo
